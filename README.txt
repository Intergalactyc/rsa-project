This project has 2 components:
1. "Large primes"
2. "RSA"

Large primes.
Code: largeprimes.py
Functions for large modular arithmetic, generation of large prime numbers, and broad prime searching.
Running this program will begin a CLI where the user can select from 3 options: generating a list of primes, generating a list of Mersenne primes, or searching for a Mersenne prime up to a certain number.

RSA.
Code: rsa.py
Functions for key generation, encryption, and decryption using the RSA cryptosystem.
Dependent on largeprimes.py.
Running this program will begin a command line demonstration of its use.
